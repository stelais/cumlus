In a case where the lens aperture is very **narrow**, the Point Spread Function (PSF) is dominated by **diffraction**. Therefore, we are going to work with the diffraction scenario, in which the lens' circular aperture is analogous to a 2D version of a single-slit experiment. \n","\n","## The Rayleigh Criterion:\n","$\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$ "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XsXJI_R85b0Y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617221358420,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":351,"user":{"displayName":"Stela Ishitani Silva","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GglkLbbZB1y7mT13cEwnaXa4GP5sP9moGF06itxBQ=s64","userId":"09832943396833439052"}}},"source":["def angular_resolution(wavelength_, diameter_aperture_):\n","  resolution__radians_ = 1.22 * wavelength_ / diameter_aperture_\n","  return angular_resolution"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"N9whe7zz7NQ8"},"source":["If point-like sources are separated by angle smaller than the angular resolution, they will not be resolved as separated sources. \n"," "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Q0H1RIBi54SC"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LLJwdZcE7mxX"},"source":["## Pixel \n","For Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) image sensors, pixels are the p-doped Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors\n","* photoactive region\n","* transmission region (shift register)\n","\n","Each capacitor accumulates an electric charge proportional to a light intensity, and then each capacitor transfers its content to its neighbor.
